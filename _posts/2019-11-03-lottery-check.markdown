I was wondering what would have happened if I persistently played my favorite
6 numbers in the Bulgarian "6 out of 49" lottery - did I ever had the chance
to win the big jackpot and simply missed it by not playing?

The short answer is - "No", but in case you were wondering the same thing, you
can now easily check. Enter any 6 numbers in the grid below and
see if they were ever played. The archive contains data starting from 1958 until
today (the data is from the [official lottery site](http://www.toto.bg/statistika/6x49)).
